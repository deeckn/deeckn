Hi, I'm Dee. I am a software engineer at LSEG. ðŸ’»

I have always been interested in the software development process, OOP practices, and developing enterprise projects. Ultimately, I would like to see my software helping others solve their problems. I am learning and continuing to improve and grow as a software engineer.

Recently, I've been immersing myself in OOP and domain modeling. Mapping real-world requirements to UML models to help product owners and the development team communicate while documenting all technical aspects along the way.
