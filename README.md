Hi, I'm Dee. I am a software engineering student at KMITL, Thailand. ðŸ’»

I have always been interested in the software development process, OOP practices, and developing enterprise projects. Ultimately, I would like to see my software helping others solve their problems. I am learning and continuing to improve and grow as a software engineer.

Recently, I've been immersing myself in full-stack web development with Next.js and Nest.js. Doing projects to tackle different technical skill sets for web development. You can check some of these projects in my public repositories!
