# Dee Chakrin 👋
Hi, I'm Dee. I am a software engineering student at KMITL, Thailand. 💻

I have always have an interest in the software development process, the OOP practices, data structures and algorithms, planning large enterprise projects. Ultimately, I would like to see my software helping others solve their problems. I am learning and continuing to improve and grow as a software engineer.

Recently, I've been immersing myself with Android Development with Java, but soon I will be moving on to multiplatform app development. I want to cover both iOS and Android users for my applications.
