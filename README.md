# Dee Chakrin ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Dee. I am a software engineering student at KMITL, Thailand. ðŸ’»

I have always have an interest in the software development process, the OOP practices, data structures and algorithms, planning large enterprise projects. Ultimately, I would like to see my software helping others solve their problems. I am learning and continuing to improve and grow as a software engineer.

Recently, I've been immersing myself with web development with React. Doing mini projects to tackle different technical skill sets for web development. You can check some of these projects down below!
